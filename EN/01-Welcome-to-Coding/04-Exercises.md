[code-task title="Expression" executionStrategy="csharp-dot-net-core-code"]

[code-editor language=csharp]
[/code-editor]

[task-description]
Write a C# program, which **calculates** and **prints** the value of the following numerical expression:
```
(3522 + 52353) * 23 - (2336 * 501 + 23432 - 6743) * 3
```

The expected **output** should look like this:
